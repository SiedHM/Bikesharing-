# Overview of the project
Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City and Hoboken. Based on the experience in New York city, an investor plans to open a similar bike business in the of city of Des Moines. For this purpose, we want to analyze the age and gender decomposition of the riders, the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
 


# Result

The over all results of the project excercise can be seen in [Tabluea](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sied.mohamed/viz/NYCBikeRidestrory/NYCBikeRideStory?publish=yes)

## Number of Bikes By gender
As can be seen from the figur below, large majority of bike riders are men. Women tend to use less.

## Trip Avarage Duration by age
The figure below shows the average trip duration by age. From this figure, we can see that younger genetations tend to bike for longer duration than older generation.

## Checkout times 
Figure below shows the number of bikes over the duration of bikes, i.e, time it takes to check out. From this graph, we can see that large proportions of  trip lasted in less than an hour. Bikes are not used for long hours of durations.

## Checkout times by gender
The figure below shows the gender disaagrigation of checkout times. For most men and women, the checkout times or the average duration of biking is for less than an hour.

## Trips by Weekday per hour
The figure below shows the number of trips on each week days and each hour. As can be seen from this figure, we can observe that the demand for bike riding is high between 5pm to 6pm on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The maxiumn is on Thursdau at 6:00pm. Further, the demand is also large demand from Monday to Friday at 8:00am.
